This Budget continues our Government ’s efforts to:  \na) accelerate growth,  \nb) secure inclusive development,  \nc) invigorate private sector investments,  \nd) uplift household sentiments, and \ne) enhance spending power of India’s rising middle class.  \n2. Together, we embark on a journey to unlock our nation’s tremendous \npotential for greater prosperity and global positioning under the leadership of \nHon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.  \n3. As we complete the first quarter of the 21st century, continuing \ngeopolitical headwinds suggest lower  global economic growth over the \nmedium term. However, our aspiration for a Viksit Bharat inspires us, and the \ntransformative work we have done during our Government ’s first two terms \nguides us, to march forward resolutely.  \nBudget Theme  \n4. Our economy is the fastest -growing among all major global economies. \nOur development track record of the past 10 years and structural reforms have \ndrawn global attention. Confidence in India’s capability and potential has only \n 2  \n \ngrown in this period. We see the next five years as a unique opportunity to \nrealize ‘Sabka Vikas’, stimulating balanced growth of all regions.  \n5. The great Telugu poet and playwright Gurajada Appa Rao had said, \n‘Desamante Matti Kaadoi, Desamante Manushuloi ’; meaning, ‘A country is not \njust its soil, a country is its people.’ In line with this, for us, Viksit Bharat, \nencompasses:  \na) zero -poverty;  \nb) hundred per cent good quality school education;   \nc) access to high -quality, affordable, and comprehensive healthcare;  \nd) hundred per cent skilled labour with meaningful employment;  \ne) seventy per cent women in economic activities; and  \nf) farmers making our country the ‘food basket of the world’.  \n6. In this Budget, the proposed development measures span ten broad \nareas focusing on Garib, Youth, Annadata and Nari.  \n1) Spurring Agricultural Growth and Productivity;  \n2) Building Rural Prosperity and Resilience;  \n3) Taking Everyone Together on an Inclusive Growth path;  \n4) Boosting Manufacturing and Furthering Make in India;  \n5) Supporting MSMEs;  \n6) Enabling Employment -led Development;  \n7) Investing in people, economy and innovation;  \n8) Securing Energy Supplies;  \n9) Promoting Exports; and  \n10) Nurturing Innovation . \n7. For this journey of development,  \na) Our four powerful engines are: Agriculture, MSME, Investment, and \nExports  \nb) The fuel: our Reforms  \nc) Our guiding spirit: Inclusivity  \nd) And the destination: Viksit Bharat  \n 3  \n \n8. This Budget aims to initiate transformative reforms across six domains. \nDuring the next five years, these will augment our growth potential and global \ncompetitiveness. The domains are:  \n1) Taxation;  \n2) Power Sector;  \n3) Urban Development;  \n4) Mining;  \n5) Financial Sector; and  \n6) Regulatory Reforms.  \nAgriculture as the 1st Engine  \n9. Now I move to specific proposals, beginning with ‘Agriculture as the 1st \nEngine’.  \nPrime Minister Dhan -Dhaanya Krishi Yojana - Developing Agri Districts \nProgramme  \n10. Motivated by the success of the Aspirational Districts Programme, our \nGovernment  will undertake a ‘Prime Minister Dhan -Dhaanya Krishi Yojana ’ in \npartnership with states. Through the convergence of existing schemes and \nspecialized measures, the programme will cover 100 districts with low \nproductivity, moderate crop intensity and below -average credit parameters. It \naims to (1) enhance agricultural  productivity, (2) adopt crop diversification and \nsustainable agriculture practices, (3) augment post -harvest stor age at the \npanchayat and block level, (4) improve irrigation facilities, and (5) facilitate \navailability of long -term and short -term credit. This programme is likely to help \n1.7 crore farmers.  \nBuilding Rural Prosperity and Resilience  \n11. A comprehensive multi -sectoral ‘Rural Prosperity and Resilience’ \nprogramme will be launched in partnership with states. This will address under -\nemployment in agriculture through skilling, investment, technology, and \ninvigorating the rural economy. The goal  is to generate ample opportunities in \nrural areas so that migration is an option, but not a necessity.  \n12. The programme will focus on rural women, young farmers, rural youth, \nmargina",
